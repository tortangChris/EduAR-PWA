# Time Complexity of Array Operations

**Short Description:**  
Array operations have predictable performance measured by **time complexity**.

**Lesson Content:**

- **Time complexity** measures how long an operation takes relative to the input size.
- **Space complexity** measures how much memory an operation consumes.
- Common Big O complexities:
  - **O(1) - Constant Time:** Accessing an element by index.
  - **O(n) - Linear Time:** Traversing the entire array.
  - **O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time:** Nested loops on arrays, e.g., comparisons in sorting.
- Array operations such as searching and traversal are **linear**, while simple access is **constant time**.

## 7. Searching a Value

**Short Description:**  
Searching is the process of finding whether a specific element exists in the array.

**Lesson Content:**

- The simplest method is **Linear Search** (Sequential Search).
- In linear search, **each element** is checked one by one until the value is found or the end is reached.
- **Time complexity:** O(n), since in the worst case, all elements may need to be checked.
- Searching is a fundamental operation before performing actions like updates or deletion.

## 8. Finding the Highest Value

**Short Description:**  
Finding the maximum element in an array involves comparing all elements to determine the largest value.

**Lesson Content:**

- Start by **assuming the first element** is the highest.
- Compare this value with the remaining elements one by one.
- If a larger value is found, **update the highest value**.
- Continue until the last element to ensure the **true maximum** is identified.
- **Time complexity:** O(n), because every element must be checked at least once.

## 9. Search and Replace a Value

**Short Description:**  
Search and replace involves locating an element and updating it with a new value.

**Lesson Content:**

- Perform a **linear search** to find the target element.
- If found, **replace its value** with the new one.
- If the element appears multiple times, the operation can replace one or all occurrences depending on the requirement.
- This is commonly used for **data updates** in arrays.
