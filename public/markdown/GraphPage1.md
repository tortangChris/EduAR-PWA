# Introduction to Graphs

- A **Graph** is a **non-linear data structure** made of:
  - **Vertices (nodes)** → represent entities.
  - **Edges** → represent relationships between entities.
- **Types of Graphs:**
  - **Undirected graph:** edges have no direction.
  - **Directed graph (digraph):** edges have direction.
  - **Weighted graph:** edges carry weights (e.g., distance, cost).
- **Real-life examples:**
  - Social networks (people = nodes, friendships = edges).
  - Maps (cities = nodes, roads = weighted edges).
  - Computer networks.

### 🎨 3D Visual

- Nodes as circles, edges as lines connecting them.

### 🌐 AR Visual

- Floating graph in space.
- User taps node → connected edges highlight.
