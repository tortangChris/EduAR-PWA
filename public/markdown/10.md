# Stacks Module

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle.  
The last element added is the first one to be removed, similar to a **stack of plates**.

## 1. Stack Data Structure

### Short Description:

A collection of elements where insertion and deletion happen only at one end, called the **top**.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**
  - A stack is a **LIFO data structure** where the most recently added element is removed first.
  - Operations are performed at a single end known as the **top**.
- **Real-Life Analogy:**
  - A stack of plates or books – the last plate placed on top is the first to be removed.
- **Applications:**
  - **Function calls** and local variable management (call stack).
  - **Undo/Redo features** in applications.
  - **Expression parsing and evaluation** (like calculators or compilers).
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** in graph algorithms.
  - **Memory management** in operating systems.
- **Implementation:**
  - Can be implemented using **arrays** or **linked lists**.

## 2. Stack Operations

### Short Description:

Stacks support basic operations to manage elements from the top.

### Lesson Content:

1. **Push**
   - Adds an element to the **top** of the stack.
   - If the stack is full, it causes **Stack Overflow**.
2. **Pop**
   - Removes the **top** element of the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, it causes **Stack Underflow**.
3. **Peek / Top**
   - Returns the **top element** without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**
   - Checks if the stack has no elements.

## 3. Time Complexity of Stack Operations

- **Push:** O(1)
- **Pop:** O(1)
- **Peek:** O(1)
- **isEmpty:** O(1)

> **Note:**  
> In array-based implementations without a tail pointer, operations may take O(n) if traversal is needed.  
> With a **top pointer**, all operations are **O(1)**.

## 4. Advantages of Stacks

- Easy to implement using arrays or linked lists.
- Efficient for **LIFO-based tasks**.
- Supports **recursive algorithms** and **backtracking problems**.

---

## 5. Disadvantages of Stacks

- Limited access (only top element can be accessed).
- Fixed size in array-based implementation may cause overflow.
- Linked list implementation requires extra memory for pointers.
