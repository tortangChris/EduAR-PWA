# Advanced Data Structures

Advanced Data Structures build on the foundational knowledge of basic structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. They are designed to solve complex computational problems more efficiently and are often used in system-level, real-time, and large-scale software applications.

## Why Learn Advanced Data Structures?

- To **optimize** time and space complexity for demanding applications.
- To handle **large-scale data** with better performance.
- To understand **core components** of algorithms in competitive programming, databases, and operating systems.
- To gain better control over **memory management** and **data access** patterns.

## Common Advanced Data Structures

### 1. **Trees**

#### a. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

- Maintains a sorted structure.
- Operations: Insert, Delete, Search — average O(log n), worst O(n).

#### b. **AVL Tree**

- Self-balancing Binary Search Tree.
- Guarantees O(log n) time for search, insert, delete by maintaining a height balance factor.

#### c. **Red-Black Tree**

- Another type of self-balancing BST.
- Used in many language libraries (e.g., `TreeMap` in Java).

#### d. **Segment Tree**

- Efficient for range queries and updates.
- Useful in scenarios like range sum, range minimum, etc.

#### e. **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**

- Used for cumulative frequency tables.
- Faster and simpler than segment trees for some problems.

### 2. **Heaps**

- A special tree-based structure satisfying the heap property.
- **Min-Heap**: Parent is less than children.
- **Max-Heap**: Parent is greater than children.
- Used in **priority queues**, **heap sort**, and **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.

---

### 3. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

- Used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
- Useful in auto-complete systems, dictionaries, and IP routing.

---

### 4. **Graphs and Related Structures**

- **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List** are standard ways to represent graphs.
- **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** or **Union-Find**:
  - Useful for network connectivity, cycle detection.
  - Supports union by rank and path compression.

---

### 5. **Hash Tables (Advanced Techniques)**

- Handle collisions using **chaining** or **open addressing**.
- Can be extended to **perfect hashing**, **cuckoo hashing**, etc., for specialized use cases.
