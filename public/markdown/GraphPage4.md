# Shortest Path Algorithms

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
  - Finds shortest path in weighted graph with non-negative weights.
  - Complexity: O(V²) or O((V+E) log V) with priority queue.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
  - Handles negative weights, slower (O(VE)).
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**
  - Finds all-pairs shortest paths, O(V³).

**Applications:**

- GPS navigation
- Routing in networks
- Game AI movement
