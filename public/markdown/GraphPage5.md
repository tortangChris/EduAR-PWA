# Advanced Graph Operations

- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**
  - Subset of edges connecting all vertices with minimum weight.
  - Algorithms: Kruskal’s, Prim’s.
- **Topological Sort:**
  - Ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- **Connected Components:**
  - Group of vertices connected by paths.

**Applications:**

- Network design
- Project scheduling
- Clustering in data analysis
