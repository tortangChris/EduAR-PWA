# Dynamic Arrays

**Short Description:**  
A dynamic array can change its size at runtime, unlike a static array.

**Lesson Content:**

- A **static array** has a fixed size determined at creation.
- A **dynamic array** allows elements to be **added or removed** as needed.
- When a dynamic array runs out of space:
  1. A **larger array** is created.
  2. **Old elements are copied** to the new array.
  3. The new array becomes the main array.
- Removing elements involves **shifting** subsequent elements to fill gaps.
- Dynamic arrays provide **flexibility** but can incur a **performance cost** during resizing.

## 12. Multi-Dimensional Arrays (Two-Dimensional Arrays)

**Short Description:**  
A multi-dimensional array stores data in a table-like structure with rows and columns.

**Lesson Content:**

- The most common form is a **two-dimensional array (2D array)**.
- A 2D array is an **array of arrays**, where each row is itself an array.
- Elements are **accessed using two indices**: `[row][column]`.
- They are useful for representing **matrices, tables, or grids**.
- The total number of elements = **rows Ã— columns**.
- Traversing a 2D array typically requires **nested loops** to access all elements.
