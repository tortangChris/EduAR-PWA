# Graph Module

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of a **set of nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges (links)**.  
Graphs are used to represent relationships and connections, such as **social networks**, **maps**, or **web pages**.

## 1. Graph Data Structure

### Short Description:

A collection of **vertices** connected by **edges**, used to model pairwise relationships between objects.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**

  - A graph is defined as `G = (V, E)`
    - `V` = set of vertices (nodes)
    - `E` = set of edges (connections between nodes)

- **Applications of Graphs:**

  - Social networks (e.g., users and their friendships)
  - Route and navigation systems (e.g., Google Maps)
  - Web page linking (e.g., Google Search Index)
  - Networking (e.g., routers and data paths)
  - Task scheduling and dependency tracking

- **Representations:**
  - **Adjacency List:** List of neighbors for each node (efficient for sparse graphs).
  - **Adjacency Matrix:** 2D matrix indicating if an edge exists between any two nodes.

## 2. Types of Graphs

### Short Description:

Graphs can be classified based on edge direction and properties.

### Lesson Content:

1. **Undirected Graph**

   - Edges have **no direction**.
   - A connection from A to B also means B to A.
   - Example: Roads between cities (bi-directional).

2. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**

   - Edges have a **specific direction**.
   - A connection from A to B doesn’t imply B to A.
   - Example: Twitter follow relationships.

3. **Weighted Graph**

   - Each edge carries a **weight** or **cost** (e.g., distance, time, bandwidth).

4. **Unweighted Graph**
   - Edges have **no weight**; only connectivity is considered.

## 3. Fundamental Concepts

### Short Description:

Important terms used when working with graphs.

### Lesson Content:

- **Vertex (Node)** – A point in the graph representing an object.
- **Edge** – A line connecting two vertices.
- **Degree** – The number of edges connected to a vertex.
  - **In-degree:** Number of edges coming into the node (directed graph).
  - **Out-degree:** Number of edges going out of the node.
- **Path** – A sequence of edges connecting vertices.
- **Cycle** – A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Connected Graph** – Every pair of vertices is connected.
- **Disconnected Graph** – Not all vertices are connected.
- **Tree** – A special kind of graph with no cycles and is connected.

## 4. Special Graph Types

### Short Description:

Commonly used specialized graphs.

### Lesson Content:

1. **Eulerian Circuit**

   - A path that **starts and ends at the same node**, visiting **each edge exactly once**.
   - Used in **network routing**, **postal delivery**, **circuit design**, and **puzzle games**.

2. **Hamiltonian Cycle**

   - A path that visits **each vertex exactly once** and returns to the starting point.
   - Used in **traveling salesman problems** and **tour planning**.

3. **Bipartite Graph**
   - Vertices can be split into **two disjoint sets** where no two vertices in the same set are adjacent.
   - Used in **matching problems**, **job assignments**, and **recommendation systems**.

## 5. Graph Operations and Time Complexity

### Short Description:

Common graph operations and their efficiency.

### Lesson Content:

| Operation               | Description                    | Time Complexity |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Add Vertex**          | Add a node to the graph        | O(1)            |
| **Remove Vertex**       | Remove a node and its edges    | O(V + E)        |
| **Add Edge**            | Add a connection between nodes | O(1)            |
| **Remove Edge**         | Remove a connection            | O(V + E)        |
| **Search Vertex**       | Find if a node exists          | O(V)            |
| **Search Edge**         | Check if a connection exists   | O(E)            |
| **Traversal (DFS/BFS)** | Visit all vertices and edges   | O(V + E)        |

> **Note:**
>
> - `V` = Number of vertices
> - `E` = Number of edges
> - DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) are used to **explore all reachable nodes**.
