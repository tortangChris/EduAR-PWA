# Introduction to Queues

- A **Queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **FIFO principle**:  
  **First In, First Out** → the earliest element added is the first removed.
- Common operations:

  - **Enqueue:** Add element at the rear.
  - **Dequeue:** Remove element from the front.

- **Real-Life Analogy:**
  - A line at the ticket counter → first person in line gets served first.

### 🎨 3D Visual

- A horizontal row of boxes (like people in line).
- Leftmost box = "front". Rightmost box = "rear".

### 🌐 AR Visual

- Floating row in AR space.
- New box slides in from right (enqueue).
- Leftmost box slides out (dequeue).
