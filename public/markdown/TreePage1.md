# Introduction to Trees

- A **Tree** is a **non-linear hierarchical data structure**.
- Consists of **nodes** connected by edges.
- Topmost node = **Root**.
- Nodes may have **children**, **siblings**, or be **leaf nodes** (no children).
- **Use cases:**
  - File systems
  - Organization charts
  - Parsing expressions
  - Databases and indexing
