## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are techniques used to arrange data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Understanding sorting is important because it is widely used in searching, organizing, and processing data efficiently.

- **Bubble Sort** → repeatedly swaps adjacent elements; simple but inefficient.

- **Selection Sort** → selects the smallest element and places it at the correct position; fewer swaps.

- **Insertion Sort** → builds the sorted list one element at a time; efficient for small or partially sorted arrays.

All three are simple sorting algorithms with O(n²) time complexity in the worst case, but they provide a solid foundation for understanding more advanced sorting techniques.
