# Graph Algorithms

Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects. Graph algorithms provide systematic methods to traverse, search, and optimize paths or connections in a graph.

## Key Concepts

- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges).
- **Directed vs. Undirected**:
  - _Directed_: Edges have direction (e.g., one-way roads).
  - _Undirected_: Edges have no direction (e.g., two-way streets).
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted**:
  - _Weighted_: Edges carry a cost or value.
  - _Unweighted_: All edges are considered equal.
- **Cyclic vs. Acyclic**:
  - _Cyclic_: Contains a path that forms a loop.
  - _Acyclic_: No loops.

## Graph Representations

- **Adjacency List**: A list where each vertex stores its neighboring vertices.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array indicating the presence (and optionally weight) of edges.

## Common Graph Algorithms

### 1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

- Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.
- Used for:
  - Cycle detection
  - Topological sorting
  - Pathfinding in mazes

### 2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

- Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
- Used for:
  - Shortest path in unweighted graphs
  - Level-order traversal

---

### 3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

- Solves the **shortest path problem** in graphs with non-negative weights.
- Uses a **priority queue** for efficiency.
- Time Complexity: O(V + E log V) with min-heap.

---

### 4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

- Computes shortest paths from a source even with **negative weights**.
- Can detect **negative weight cycles**.
- Time Complexity: O(VE)

---

### 5. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

- Finds **all-pairs shortest paths**.
- Works with negative weights (but not negative cycles).
- Time Complexity: O(V³)

---

### 6. **Prim's Algorithm**

- Finds a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** using a **greedy** approach.
- Expands the MST by picking the minimum weight edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited one.

### 7. **Kruskal's Algorithm**

- Also finds MST.
- Sorts all edges and adds them one by one using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** to avoid cycles.

---

### 8. **Topological Sorting**

- Orders vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that for any directed edge `u → v`, `u` comes before `v`.
- Used in:
  - Task scheduling
  - Build systems

---

### 9. **Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**

- Efficiently tracks connected components.
- Key for Kruskal’s algorithm and cycle detection.
