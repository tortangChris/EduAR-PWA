# Insertion Sort (O(n²))

- **Idea:** Build a sorted part of the array one element at a time.
- Insert each element into its correct position relative to sorted part.
- **Time Complexity:**

  - Best: O(n).
  - Worst: O(n²).

- **Example:**
  ```
  [5, 2, 4, 6]
   → [2, 5, 4, 6]
   → [2, 4, 5, 6]
   → [2, 4, 5, 6]
  ```
