# Graph Traversals

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
  - Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Implemented via recursion/stack.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
  - Explore neighbors level by level.
  - Implemented via queue.

**Complexity:** O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges.

**Use Cases:**

- DFS → topological sorting, solving puzzles.
- BFS → shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### 🎨 3D Visual

- DFS: path diving deep then backtracking.
- BFS: level-by-level expansion.

### 🌐 AR Visual

- User chooses DFS/BFS → traversal animation shows highlighted path.
