# Access Operation (O(1))

- **Access** = retrieving an element directly using its **index**.
- Arrays support **direct access** because their memory addresses are sequential.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` â†’ **constant time**, regardless of array size.

- **Example**
  ```text
  arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
  arr[2] = 30   # Accessing element at index 2
  ```
