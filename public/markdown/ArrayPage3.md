# Search Operation (O(n))

- **Searching** means looking for an element in the array.
- **Linear Search:**
  - Start from index `0`, check each element one by one until found or until end of array.
- **Worst-case:** The element might be at the last position (or not present at all).
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` → proportional to the size of the array.

- **Example**
  ```text
  arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
  Search 30 → Found at index 2 after checking 3 elements
  ```
