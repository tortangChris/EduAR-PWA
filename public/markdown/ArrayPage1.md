# Introduction to Arrays

An **array** is a **linear collection of elements** stored in **contiguous memory locations**.

This means that all the elements are placed next to each other in memory, making it easy to calculate the address of any element directly.

- **Example**

  ```text
  [10, 20, 30, 40]
  Index:  0   1   2   3
  ```

- **Use Cases**
  - Storing lists of numbers, strings, or objects.
  - Representing tables (2D arrays).
  - Useful in algorithms, data processing, and memory-efficient structures.
