# Skip List

### Short Description:

A probabilistic data structure that allows **fast search, insertion, and deletion** by using multiple levels of linked lists.

### Lesson Content:

- **Concept:**
  - Invented by **William Pugh (1989)**.
  - Consists of multiple **layers of linked lists**.
  - Higher levels **skip** elements to allow faster traversal.
- **How it works:**
  1. Lowest level: contains all elements (fully linked list).
  2. Upper levels: contain fewer elements for skipping.
  3. Search starts from top-left, moving **right** and **down**.
- **Advantages:**
  - Faster search compared to regular linked lists.
  - Balances **simplicity of linked lists** with **speed of binary search trees**.
- **Time Complexities:**
  - **Search:** O(log n)
  - **Insertion:** O(log n)
  - **Deletion:** O(log n)
