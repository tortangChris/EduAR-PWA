# Trees Module

A **tree** is a hierarchical, nonlinear data structure made up of nodes connected by edges.  
It is used to represent relationships such as family trees, file systems, or organizational structures.

## 1. Tree Data Structure

### Short Description:

A collection of nodes connected in a **hierarchical** (nonlinear) fashion, starting from a root node.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**

  - A tree consists of **nodes** and **edges**.
  - The **topmost node** is the **root**, and each node may have **child nodes**.
  - Trees are different from linear structures like arrays and linked lists.

- **Important Terminologies:**

  - **Node** – Element in the tree that contains data and may have child nodes.
  - **Edge** – The connection between parent and child nodes.
  - **Root** – The topmost node in the tree.
  - **Parent** – A node that has one or more children.
  - **Child** – A node that descends from another node.
  - **Leaf** – A node that has no children.
  - **Subtree** – A section of a tree starting from any node.
  - **Path** – A sequence of nodes connected by edges.
  - **Levels** – Distance from the root. The root is at level 0.
  - **Key** – Value stored in a node.

- **Applications:**
  - Organizing hierarchical data (e.g., XML, JSON).
  - Routing algorithms.
  - Databases (e.g., B-trees, indexing).
  - Compiler syntax trees.

## 2. Recursion

### Short Description:

A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**

  - Recursion allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into subproblems.
  - Trees are **naturally recursive** structures because each subtree is itself a tree.

- **Why Recursion is suited for Trees:**
  - Operations like traversal (visit all nodes) are inherently recursive.
  - Recursive algorithms simplify implementation of complex tree operations.

## 3. Introduction to Tree Data Structure

### Short Description:

Understanding how tree structures differ from linear ones like arrays and linked lists.

### Lesson Content:

- **Nature of Trees:**

  - Unlike arrays or lists, trees do not store elements in a sequence.
  - Instead, they branch out, making them ideal for representing **hierarchies**.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Provide better performance in scenarios where linear search becomes costly (O(n)).
  - Tree operations can often be done in O(log n) time, depending on the structure.

## 4. Binary Tree

### Short Description:

A tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**.

### Lesson Content:

- **Structure:**

  - Each node has a left child and a right child.
  - The children can themselves be roots of subtrees.

- **Properties:**

  - The **maximum** number of children per node is 2.
  - If all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, it is a **complete binary tree**.

- **Applications:**
  - Expression trees in compilers.
  - Hierarchical sorting and searching.
  - Huffman encoding trees.

## 5. Binary Search Tree (BST)

### Short Description:

A type of binary tree where elements are **ordered** to allow efficient searching.

### Lesson Content:

- **Ordering Rule:**

  - For any node `N`:
    - All nodes in the **left subtree** are **less than** `N`.
    - All nodes in the **right subtree** are **greater than** `N`.

- **Advantages:**

  - Allows fast search, insert, and delete operations.
  - If balanced, time complexity is **O(log n)**.

- **Important Notes:**

  - New nodes are always inserted as **leaf nodes**.
  - Searching starts at the root and moves left or right depending on the value.

- **Drawback:**
  - If the tree becomes skewed (like a linked list), performance degrades to O(n).

## 6. Tree Traversal Using Recursion

### Short Description:

Visiting all nodes in a tree using a recursive approach.

### Lesson Content:

#### a. In-order Traversal (Left → Root → Right)

- Visit left subtree first, then root, then right subtree.
- In BSTs, this results in **sorted order** of values.

#### b. Pre-order Traversal (Root → Left → Right)

- Visit root first, then left and right.
- Useful for copying or serializing trees.

#### c. Post-order Traversal (Left → Right → Root)

- Visit left and right subtrees first, then root.
- Useful for deleting or evaluating expression trees.

- **Use Cases of Traversal:**
  - Printing all elements.
  - Searching for an item.
  - Evaluating expressions.
