# Introduction to Sorting

- **Sorting** = process of arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- **Importance:**
  - Easier searching (binary search requires sorted data).
  - Better organization of data.
  - Common in real-world (ranking, leaderboards, database queries).
- Two major categories:
  1. **Simple/Quadratic Sorts** (Bubble, Insertion, Selection).
  2. **Efficient Sorts** (Merge, Quick, Heap).
