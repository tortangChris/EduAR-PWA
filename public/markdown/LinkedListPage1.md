## Linked List

### Nodes + Arrows

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements, called **nodes**, are connected using **pointers (arrows)**.  
Each node typically contains:

- **Data**: the actual value stored.
- **Next pointer**: a reference (arrow) to the next node in the list.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in continuous memory locations. Instead, each node points to the next, forming a chain.

**Key Points:**

- Dynamic size (easy to grow/shrink).
- Insertion and deletion are efficient compared to arrays.
- Traversal requires moving from node to node.
