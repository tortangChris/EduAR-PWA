# Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant computation.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The problem can be broken down into smaller, reusable subproblems.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Memoization**: Top-down approach using recursion with a cache.
- **Tabulation**: Bottom-up approach using iteration and tables to build the solution.

## Steps to Solve DP Problems

1. **Characterize the structure** of the optimal solution.
2. **Define the recursive relation** (recurrence).
3. **Determine the base cases**.
4. **Decide memoization or tabulation**.
5. **Optimize further if needed** (e.g., space optimization).

## Classic Dynamic Programming Problems

### 1. **Fibonacci Numbers**

- Problem: Compute the nth Fibonacci number.
- Recurrence: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
- Time Complexity:
  - Recursive: O(2ⁿ)
  - Memoized / Tabulated: O(n)

---

### 2. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**

- Problem: Maximize total value without exceeding capacity.
- Recurrence:
  - `dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - wt[i]] + val[i])`
- Time Complexity: O(nW)  
  _(n = items, W = capacity)_

### 3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**

- Problem: Find the length of the longest subsequence present in both sequences.
- Recurrence:
  - If `X[i] == Y[j]`: `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
  - Else: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
- Time Complexity: O(mn)

---

### 4. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**

- Problem: Find the longest strictly increasing subsequence in a sequence.
- Time Complexity:
  - DP: O(n²)
  - With binary search optimization: O(n log n)

---

### 5. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**

- Problem: Determine the most efficient way to multiply matrices.
- Recurrence:
  - `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost of multiplication)`
- Time Complexity: O(n³)

---

### 6. **Edit Distance**

- Problem: Minimum operations to convert one string to another (insert, delete, replace).
- Recurrence:
  - Based on operations needed when characters match or don’t.
- Time Complexity: O(mn)

---

### 7. **Rod Cutting Problem**

- Problem: Maximize profit by cutting a rod into smaller lengths.
- Similar to unbounded knapsack.
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

## Memoization vs Tabulation Comparison

| Feature     | Memoization (Top-Down)                   | Tabulation (Bottom-Up)        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Approach    | Recursive with cache                     | Iterative                     |
| Stack Usage | Uses call stack (risk of stack overflow) | No recursion involved         |
| Ease of Use | Easier for beginners                     | Usually more efficient        |
| Time/Space  | Similar in complexity                    | More control over space usage |
