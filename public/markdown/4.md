# Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. The choice of the right data structure can greatly affect the performance of an algorithm or application.

## Why Are Data Structures Important?

- **Efficiency**: Proper data structures improve time and space complexity.
- **Reusability**: Once implemented, they can be used across multiple programs.
- **Abstraction**: They allow programmers to manage and model data logically.
- **Scalability**: Applications built on efficient data structures can scale more effectively.

## Classification of Data Structures

### 1. **Primitive Data Structures**

These are basic data types that serve as the foundation for other types:

- Integer
- Float
- Character
- Boolean

### 2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**

These structures are more complex and include:

#### a. **Linear Data Structures**

- **Array**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked List**: A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

#### b. **Non-Linear Data Structures**

- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure where each node has a parent and child nodes. Example: Binary Tree.
- **Graph**: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)

An Abstract Data Type is a theoretical concept that defines data and operations on the data without specifying the implementation.

Examples of ADTs include:

- List
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- Set
- Map

## Operations on Data Structures

Common operations that can be performed on data structures include:

- **Insertion**: Adding an element to the data structure.
- **Deletion**: Removing an element.
- **Traversal**: Accessing each element once.
- **Searching**: Finding the location of an element.
- **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order.

## Choosing the Right Data Structure

The choice of data structure depends on several factors:

- The nature of operations required
- Memory usage
- Speed of access
- Frequency of insertion/deletion

## Real-world Applications

- **Stacks** are used in undo functionality in editors.
- **Queues** are used in print spoolers and scheduling.
- **Trees** are used in file systems and databases.
- **Graphs** are used in social networks and routing algorithms.
