## Array Data Structure

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming. They allow us to store multiple values of the **same data type** under a single variable name, making it easier to manage and organize data.

- **Declaring** → defines the type of array.
- **Creating** → allocates memory and sets size.
- **Accessing** → retrieves or assigns values using index.
- **Looping** → allows us to process all elements efficiently.

Arrays are powerful tools that help organize and manage collections of data in programming.
