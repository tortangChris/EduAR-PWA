# Arrays Module

This module introduces **arrays** as a data structure, their operations, and variations such as **dynamic** and **multi-dimensional arrays**.

---

## 1. Array Data Structure

**Short Description:**  
A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory, accessed using an index.

**Lesson Content:**

- An array is a data structure that allows a programmer to store a **fixed number of values** in a single storage.
- All values in an array must be of the **same data type**.
- Each value in the array is called an **element** and is identified by a **numerical index**.
- **Indexing starts at 0**, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on.
- Arrays are commonly used to group related data and allow **easy access** to elements using their index.

## 2. Declaring an Array

**Short Description:**  
Before using an array, it must be declared with a data type and name.

**Lesson Content:**

- Arrays are **objects in Java** and must be declared before use.
- Declaration specifies the **data type of elements** and the **array name**.
- Declaring an array does **not yet allocate memory**; it only tells the program what type of elements it will store.
- Once declared, the array can then be created to allocate memory.
- **Arrays have a fixed size once created** and cannot be resized.

---

## 3. Creating an Array

**Short Description:**  
After declaration, arrays must be created to allocate memory.

**Lesson Content:**

- Creating an array allocates a **fixed block of memory** for its elements.
- The **size of the array is set upon creation** and cannot be changed later.
- Once created, the array can store elements according to the specified type and size.
- Proper creation of an array ensures the program has reserved memory to hold its elements.

## 4. Accessing a Value in an Array

**Short Description:**  
Elements in an array are accessed using their index number.

**Lesson Content:**

- Each element in an array is stored at a specific **index**.
- The **first element** is accessed at index `0`, the second at `1`, and so on.
- Accessing an array element means retrieving the **value stored** at the given index.
- If an invalid index is used (negative or beyond the last index), a **runtime error** occurs.
- Arrays allow **fast access** to elements because indices are mapped directly to memory locations.

---

## 5. Looping Through an Array

**Short Description:**  
Arrays are typically processed using loops to access elements sequentially.

**Lesson Content:**

- **Loops** (for, while, do-while) are commonly used to traverse arrays.
- A **for loop** is the most convenient way to iterate through all elements from index `0` to the last index.
- Traversing an array means performing actions such as **reading, displaying, or modifying** its elements one by one.
- Looping is essential for **bulk operations** like summing values, searching elements, or performing computations on each item.

## 6. Time Complexity of Array Operations

**Short Description:**  
Array operations have predictable performance measured by **time complexity**.

**Lesson Content:**

- **Time complexity** measures how long an operation takes relative to the input size.
- **Space complexity** measures how much memory an operation consumes.
- Common Big O complexities:
  - **O(1) - Constant Time:** Accessing an element by index.
  - **O(n) - Linear Time:** Traversing the entire array.
  - **O(n²) - Quadratic Time:** Nested loops on arrays, e.g., comparisons in sorting.
- Array operations such as searching and traversal are **linear**, while simple access is **constant time**.

---

## 7. Searching a Value

**Short Description:**  
Searching is the process of finding whether a specific element exists in the array.

**Lesson Content:**

- The simplest method is **Linear Search** (Sequential Search).
- In linear search, **each element** is checked one by one until the value is found or the end is reached.
- **Time complexity:** O(n), since in the worst case, all elements may need to be checked.
- Searching is a fundamental operation before performing actions like updates or deletion.

---

## 8. Finding the Highest Value

**Short Description:**  
Finding the maximum element in an array involves comparing all elements to determine the largest value.

**Lesson Content:**

- Start by **assuming the first element** is the highest.
- Compare this value with the remaining elements one by one.
- If a larger value is found, **update the highest value**.
- Continue until the last element to ensure the **true maximum** is identified.
- **Time complexity:** O(n), because every element must be checked at least once.

---

## 9. Search and Replace a Value

**Short Description:**  
Search and replace involves locating an element and updating it with a new value.

**Lesson Content:**

- Perform a **linear search** to find the target element.
- If found, **replace its value** with the new one.
- If the element appears multiple times, the operation can replace one or all occurrences depending on the requirement.
- This is commonly used for **data updates** in arrays.

---

## 10. Sorting Algorithms

**Short Description:**  
Sorting arranges array elements in ascending or descending order.

**Lesson Content:**

- Sorting is essential for **organizing data** and is often a prerequisite for efficient searching.
- Basic sorting algorithms:
  1. **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  2. **Selection Sort:** Finds the minimum (or maximum) and places it in the correct position in each pass.
  3. **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Bubble Sort → O(n²)
  - Selection Sort → O(n²)
  - Insertion Sort → O(n²) worst case, O(n) best case (already sorted)

## 11. Dynamic Arrays

**Short Description:**  
A dynamic array can change its size at runtime, unlike a static array.

**Lesson Content:**

- A **static array** has a fixed size determined at creation.
- A **dynamic array** allows elements to be **added or removed** as needed.
- When a dynamic array runs out of space:
  1. A **larger array** is created.
  2. **Old elements are copied** to the new array.
  3. The new array becomes the main array.
- Removing elements involves **shifting** subsequent elements to fill gaps.
- Dynamic arrays provide **flexibility** but can incur a **performance cost** during resizing.

---

## 12. Multi-Dimensional Arrays (Two-Dimensional Arrays)

**Short Description:**  
A multi-dimensional array stores data in a table-like structure with rows and columns.

**Lesson Content:**

- The most common form is a **two-dimensional array (2D array)**.
- A 2D array is an **array of arrays**, where each row is itself an array.
- Elements are **accessed using two indices**: `[row][column]`.
- They are useful for representing **matrices, tables, or grids**.
- The total number of elements = **rows × columns**.
- Traversing a 2D array typically requires **nested loops** to access all elements.
