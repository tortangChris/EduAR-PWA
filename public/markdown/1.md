# Arrays Module

This module introduces **arrays** as a data structure, their operations, and variations such as **dynamic** and **multi-dimensional arrays**.

## 1. Array Data Structure

**Short Description:**  
A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory, accessed using an index.

**Lesson Content:**

- An array is a data structure that allows a programmer to store a **fixed number of values** in a single storage.
- All values in an array must be of the **same data type**.
- Each value in the array is called an **element** and is identified by a **numerical index**.
- **Indexing starts at 0**, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on.
- Arrays are commonly used to group related data and allow **easy access** to elements using their index.

## 2. Declaring an Array

**Short Description:**  
Before using an array, it must be declared with a data type and name.

**Lesson Content:**

- Arrays are **objects in Java** and must be declared before use.
- Declaration specifies the **data type of elements** and the **array name**.
- Declaring an array does **not yet allocate memory**; it only tells the program what type of elements it will store.
- Once declared, the array can then be created to allocate memory.
- **Arrays have a fixed size once created** and cannot be resized.

## 3. Creating an Array

**Short Description:**  
After declaration, arrays must be created to allocate memory.

**Lesson Content:**

- Creating an array allocates a **fixed block of memory** for its elements.
- The **size of the array is set upon creation** and cannot be changed later.
- Once created, the array can store elements according to the specified type and size.
- Proper creation of an array ensures the program has reserved memory to hold its elements.

## 4. Accessing a Value in an Array

**Short Description:**  
Elements in an array are accessed using their index number.

**Lesson Content:**

- Each element in an array is stored at a specific **index**.
- The **first element** is accessed at index `0`, the second at `1`, and so on.
- Accessing an array element means retrieving the **value stored** at the given index.
- If an invalid index is used (negative or beyond the last index), a **runtime error** occurs.
- Arrays allow **fast access** to elements because indices are mapped directly to memory locations.

## 5. Looping Through an Array

**Short Description:**  
Arrays are typically processed using loops to access elements sequentially.

**Lesson Content:**

- **Loops** (for, while, do-while) are commonly used to traverse arrays.
- A **for loop** is the most convenient way to iterate through all elements from index `0` to the last index.
- Traversing an array means performing actions such as **reading, displaying, or modifying** its elements one by one.
- Looping is essential for **bulk operations** like summing values, searching elements, or performing computations on each item.
