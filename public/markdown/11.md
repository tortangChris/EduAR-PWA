# Queue Module

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** principle.  
The first element added is the first one to be removed, similar to a **line of people**.

## 1. Queue Data Structure

### Short Description:

A collection of elements where insertion happens at the **rear** and deletion happens at the **front**.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**
  - A queue is a **FIFO data structure** where the element that enters first is removed first.
  - Elements are added at the **rear (enqueue)** and removed from the **front (dequeue)**.
- **Real-Life Analogy:**
  - A line at a ticket counter â€“ the person who comes first is served first.
- **Applications:**
  - **Task scheduling** in operating systems (CPU queues).
  - **Print queue** management in printers.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in graph traversal.
  - **Order processing systems**.
- **Implementation:**
  - Can be implemented using **arrays**, **linked lists**, or **circular buffers**.

## 2. Queue Operations

### Short Description:

Queues support basic operations to manage elements in FIFO order.

### Lesson Content:

1. **Enqueue**

   - Adds an element at the **rear** of the queue.
   - If the queue is full (in fixed-size arrays), this causes **Overflow**.

2. **Dequeue**

   - Removes the element from the **front** of the queue.
   - If the queue is empty, this causes **Underflow**.

3. **Peek / Front**

   - Returns the **front element** without removing it.

4. **isEmpty**
   - Checks if the queue is empty.

## 3. Time Complexity of Queue Operations

- **Enqueue:** O(1)
- **Dequeue:** O(1)
- **Peek:** O(1)
- **isEmpty:** O(1)

## 4. Advantages of Queues

- Maintains **order of processing** (FIFO).
- Useful for **buffering, scheduling, and real-time processing**.
- Can be implemented in **different forms**:
  - **Simple Queue**
  - **Circular Queue**
  - **Priority Queue**
  - **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**

---

## 5. Disadvantages of Queues

- Limited random access (only front and rear can be accessed directly).
- Fixed-size implementation may lead to **wasted space** if not using circular arrays.
- **Overflow** and **Underflow** need to be handled.
