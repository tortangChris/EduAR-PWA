# Sorting Algorithms

**Short Description:**  
Sorting arranges array elements in ascending or descending order.

**Lesson Content:**

- Sorting is essential for **organizing data** and is often a prerequisite for efficient searching.
- Basic sorting algorithms:
  1. **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  2. **Selection Sort:** Finds the minimum (or maximum) and places it in the correct position in each pass.
  3. **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Bubble Sort → O(n²)
  - Selection Sort → O(n²)
  - Insertion Sort → O(n²) worst case, O(n) best case (already sorted)
