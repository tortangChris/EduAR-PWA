# Linked List Module

This module introduces **Linked Lists**, their variations, and their time complexities.  
Linked Lists provide a dynamic way to store elements where each node points to the next (or previous) node.

## 1. Linked List Data Structure

### Short Description:

A linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers or references.

### Lesson Content:

- A **Linked List** is a collection of nodes where each node contains:
  1. **Data** – the actual value stored.
  2. **Pointer (Next)** – reference to the next node in the sequence.
- Unlike arrays, linked lists **do not require contiguous memory allocation**.
- **Advantages:**
  - Dynamic size (can grow or shrink at runtime).
  - Efficient insertions and deletions in the middle or ends without shifting elements.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - No random access (elements must be accessed sequentially).
  - Requires extra memory for pointers.
