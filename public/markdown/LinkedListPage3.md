## Doubly Linked List

### Next + Prev Pointers

A **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** is a linked list where each node has **two pointers**:

- **Next pointer**: points to the next node.
- **Previous pointer**: points to the previous node.

**Advantages over singly linked list:**

- Can traverse in both directions (forward and backward).
- Easier to delete a node when given a pointer to it.

**Trade-off:**

- Requires more memory (extra pointer).
- More complex to implement.
