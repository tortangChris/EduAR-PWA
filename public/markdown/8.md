# Doubly Linked List

### Short Description:

A linked list where each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

### Lesson Content:

- **Structure:**
  - Node contains:
    1. **Data**
    2. **Next Pointer**
    3. **Previous Pointer**
- **Advantages:**
  1. **Bidirectional traversal** (forward and backward)
  2. **Efficient insertions and deletions** without needing to traverse the whole list to find the previous node
  3. **Reverse iteration** is simple and faster
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Higher memory cost (extra pointer)
  - More complex operations to maintain list integrity

## 7. Time Complexity of Doubly Linked List Operations

- **Insertion at head/tail:** O(1)
- **Insertion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Deletion at head/tail:** O(1)
- **Deletion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Search:** O(n)
