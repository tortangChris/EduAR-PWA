# Graph Representation

1. **Adjacency Matrix:**
   - 2D array, matrix[i][j] = 1 if edge exists, else 0.
   - Pros: simple, fast edge lookup.
   - Cons: uses O(V²) space.
2. **Adjacency List:**
   - Each vertex stores list of connected vertices.
   - Pros: efficient for sparse graphs.
   - Cons: slower for direct edge lookup.

- Matrix grid vs linked list representation side by side.

### 🌐 AR Visual

- User switches between adjacency matrix and list view.
