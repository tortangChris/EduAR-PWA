# Set Module

A **set** is a data structure that stores **unordered, unique elements**.  
It is inspired by **mathematical set theory** and is useful for **ensuring uniqueness** and performing operations like union and intersection.

## 1. Set Data Structure

### Short Description:

A structure that stores **distinct elements** without any particular order.

### Lesson Content:

- **Definition:**

  - A **set** is a collection of **unique items**.
  - It does **not allow duplicates**.
  - It can be used when the order of elements doesn't matter, but **uniqueness** is required.

- **Real-Life Analogy:**

  - A bag of unique keys where no key is repeated.
  - A class attendance list without duplicate names.

- **Applications:**

  - Checking for **duplicates**.
  - **Membership testing** (e.g., is a value present?).
  - Performing **set theory operations** like union, intersection, and difference.
  - Used in algorithms (e.g., removing duplicates from lists, graph algorithms, etc.).

- **Implementation:**
  - Sets can be implemented using **hash tables**, **binary trees**, or **arrays** with checks for uniqueness.

## 2. Introduction to Sets

### Short Description:

Understanding the concept and need for sets in computer science.

### Lesson Content:

- **Key Properties of Sets:**

  - **Unordered** – The order of elements doesn't matter.
  - **No Duplicates** – Each element must be unique.
  - **Efficient Operations** – Supports quick add, remove, and check operations.

- **Set in Programming:**

  - Sets are provided in many programming languages.
  - Underlying data structures like **hash tables** or **balanced trees** are used to maintain performance.

- **Set Use Cases:**
  - Removing duplicates from a list.
  - Filtering data.
  - Efficient lookup.
  - Representing relationships (e.g., friends of a user in social media).

## 3. Set Operations

### Short Description:

Operations that can be performed on sets to combine or compare elements.

### Lesson Content:

1. **Addition (or Insertion)**

   - Adds a new element to the set.
   - If the element already exists, the set remains unchanged.

2. **Removal**

   - Removes an element from the set if it exists.

3. **Containment Check**

   - Checks whether a particular element is in the set.

4. **Union**

   - Combines elements of two sets into one set (all unique elements from both).

5. **Intersection**

   - Finds common elements between two sets.

6. **Difference**

   - Gets elements that are in one set but **not** in the other.

7. **Subset Check**

   - Determines if all elements of one set are contained in another.

8. **Equality Check**

   - Returns true if two sets contain **exactly the same** elements.

9. **Clear**

   - Removes all elements from the set, leaving it empty.

10. **Size (Cardinality)**
    - Returns the **number of elements** in the set.

- **Note:**
  - Sets may use different structures under the hood (e.g., hash sets, tree sets), which affect performance.
  - Common complexity for add, remove, and contains: **O(1)** (for hash-based sets).
