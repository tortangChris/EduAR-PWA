# Introduction to Linked List

### Short Description:

Linked Lists are used to efficiently insert or delete elements without shifting data like in arrays.

### Lesson Content:

- **Singly Linked List:**
  - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
  - The last node points to **NULL** (indicating the end of the list).
- **Operations:**
  - **Insertion** (beginning, middle, end)
  - **Deletion** (remove a node)
  - **Traversal** (visiting all nodes sequentially)
- **Use cases:**
  - Dynamic memory allocation
  - Stacks and queues implementation
  - Efficient insertions/deletions in non-contiguous memory

## 3. Time Complexity of Linked List Operations

### Short Description:

Common linked list operations have predictable time complexities based on traversal requirements.

### Lesson Content:

- **Insertion at head:** O(1)
- **Insertion at tail:** O(n) without tail pointer, O(1) with tail pointer
- **Insertion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Deletion at head:** O(1)
- **Deletion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Searching for an element:** O(n)
- **Traversal to process or print elements:** O(n)
