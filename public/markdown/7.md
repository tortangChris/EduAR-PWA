# Circular Linked List

### Short Description:

A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

### Lesson Content:

- **Structure:**
  - The last node does not point to NULL but to the first node.
  - Enables **continuous looping** of the list.
- **Advantages:**
  1. **Infinite Looping:** Useful for round-robin scheduling.
  2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions** at beginning and end.
  3. **Resource Management:** Useful in cyclic resource distribution.
  4. **Space Efficiency:** No need for NULL references.
  5. **Easier Reversal** compared to linear lists.
- **Applications:**
  - Music or media playlists
  - Round-robin CPU scheduling
  - Traffic light cycles
  - Simulations that repeat in cycles

## 5. Time Complexity of Circular Linked List Operations

- **Insertion at beginning:** O(1)
- **Insertion at end:** O(1)
- **Insertion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Deletion at beginning:** O(1)
- **Deletion at end:** O(n)
- **Deletion at arbitrary position:** O(n)
- **Search for element:** O(n)
- **Traversal or finding length:** O(n)
