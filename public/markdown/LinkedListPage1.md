# Introduction to Linked Lists

- A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (**nodes**) are connected using **pointers/references**.
- Each **node** has two parts:
  1. **Data** (stores value).
  2. **Pointer/Reference** (points to next node).
- Unlike arrays, linked lists do **not use contiguous memory**.
- **Advantage:** Dynamic memory allocation (can grow/shrink at runtime).
- **Disadvantage:** Slower access (must traverse nodes sequentially).
