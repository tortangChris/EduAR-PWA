# Introduction to Stacks

- A **Stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO principle**:  
  **Last In, First Out** → the most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- Common operations:

  - **Push:** Add an element to the top.
  - **Pop:** Remove the top element.
  - **Peek/Top:** View the top element without removing it.

- **Real-Life Analogy:**
  - A stack of plates → last plate placed is the first one you take off.
