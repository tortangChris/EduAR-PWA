# Sorting Algorithms

**Sorting algorithms** are used to reorder elements in a list or array according to a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the performance of other algorithms (such as search and merge operations), which require input data to be in sorted order.

## Types of Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort

**Bubble sort** is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
- Swap them if the first is greater than the second.
- Repeat the process for all elements until the list is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best case: **O(n)** (when the list is already sorted)
- Worst and average case: **O(n²)**

**Advantages:**

- Easy to implement.
- Good for small or nearly sorted datasets.

**Disadvantages:**

- Very inefficient for large datasets.

### 2. Selection Sort

**Selection sort** divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Find the minimum element in the unsorted array.
- Swap it with the first unsorted element.
- Move the boundary of the sorted and unsorted regions forward.
- Repeat until the array is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best, average, and worst case: **O(n²)**

**Advantages:**

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Performs well on small lists.

**Disadvantages:**

- Inefficient on large datasets.
- More swaps than other simple algorithms.

### 3. Insertion Sort

**Insertion sort** builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Start with the second element.
- Compare it with elements before it and insert it into the correct position.
- Repeat for all elements.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best case: **O(n)** (when the array is already sorted)
- Average and worst case: **O(n²)**

**Advantages:**

- Simple to implement.
- Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
- Stable sorting algorithm.

**Disadvantages:**

- Inefficient on large datasets.

### 4. Merge Sort

**Merge sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Divide the list into two halves.
- Recursively sort both halves.
- Merge the sorted halves.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best, average, and worst case: **O(n log n)**

**Advantages:**

- Very efficient for large datasets.
- Stable sort.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires additional space (not in-place).

### 5. Quick Sort

**Quick sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into two sub-arrays around a pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Choose a pivot element.
- Rearrange elements so that all smaller elements are before the pivot and all larger ones are after.
- Recursively apply the process to the sub-arrays.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best and average case: **O(n log n)**
- Worst case: **O(n²)** (when pivot is poorly chosen)

**Advantages:**

- Very fast in practice.
- In-place sorting (no extra memory needed).

**Disadvantages:**

- Not stable.
- Performance depends heavily on pivot choice.

### 6. Heap Sort

**Heap sort** involves building a max-heap from the data and then repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap and placing it at the end of the array.

**Algorithm Steps:**

- Build a max-heap from the input data.
- Swap the first and last elements.
- Reduce the heap size and heapify the root.
- Repeat until the heap is empty.

**Time Complexity:**

- Best, average, and worst case: **O(n log n)**

**Advantages:**

- Efficient and in-place.
- Not sensitive to the data order.

**Disadvantages:**

- Not a stable sort.
